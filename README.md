# TEDS22 project: Character Recognition
## In this project:
1. Code for cropping the images based on the polygons, the [crop_polygon](crop_polygon.ipynb) notebook.
2. Code for creating and training the model, the [fine_tuning](fine-tuning_2.ipynb) notebook.
4. Code for compressing the model into a tflite model, the [TFLITE_conversion](TFLITE_conversion.ipynb) notebook. The compressed model should be ~30% of the size. 
3. Python library prerequisites, in [requirements.txt](requirements.txt) (altough most libraries are not needed).
